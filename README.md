Arch Install Project1


    Assignment Description

    Now that you have a solid foundation of Linux, it's time to create your own Linux VM instead of relying on pre-built distributions. Why would you do such a thing? Well... there are lots (hundreds) of different Linux distros for a reason - different people want different things. Being able to tailor your Linux OS to exactly what you want in there, and nothing else, is a feature that neither Windows or macOS provide. Most importantly, for this course, creating your own Linux VM will provide you a tangible artifact that proves you can use the baseline Linux skills you have learned to do something potentially useful.

    In this assignment, you will create your own Arch Linux VM with the following modifications:

    1) The Arch Linux installation wiki ends without a GUI-based desktop environment (DE). You will choose and install a compatible DE. At very least, you should install LXDE, which is a very light-weight desktop that uses less hard drive space. BUT... this is not a requirement. Choose a DE that you like.

    2) Create a user account for yourself and codi with sudo permissions. The user name for Codi shall be "codi" and the password shall be "GraceHopper1906" and be set to be changed after login.

    3) Install a different shell other than bash, such as zsh or fish.

    4) Install ssh and use it to ssh into the class gateway (129.244.245.111).

    5) Add color coding to the terminal (like you see in the archiso during installation).

    6) Set the system to boot into the GUI desktop environment.

    7) Add a few aliases to .bashrc or .zshrc. Need some ideas for good Linux aliases? Check here.


    What will you turn in for your assignment? There are two deliverables for this task:
        Process Documentation
        Walkthrough video

    See the next two posts below for guidance on your installation process documentation and walkthrough video.
